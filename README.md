# My First Data Science Project with Poetry and DataSpell

This is my very first data science project, and more importantly, my first time creating a structured Python environment using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency and project management.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Project Is

A simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the `tips` dataset from Seaborn. This project helped me set up a clean, reproducible Python environment, run Jupyter notebooks inside JetBrains DataSpell, and understand how to structure a technical project for GitHub.

## ðŸ”§ What I Learned

### âœ… Environment Setup with Poetry
- Created a project using `poetry new my-first-ds-project`
- Added dependencies like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `jupyter`, and `seaborn` via:
  ```bash
  poetry add pandas matplotlib jupyter seaborn
